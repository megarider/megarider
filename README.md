MegaRider Armature Video Game
=============================

An old skul video game that mimics Outrun re-done in modern day HTML5 and Javascript

A note on performance
=====================

The performance of this game is **very** machine/browser dependent. It works quite well in modern
browsers, especially those with GPU canvas acceleration, but a bad graphics driver can kill it stone
dead. So your mileage may vary. There are controls provided to change the rendering resolution
and the draw distance to scale to fit your machine.

Currently supported browsers include:

 * Firefox (v12+) works great, 60fps at high res - Nice!
 * Chrome (v19+) works great, 60fps at high res... provided you dont have a bad GPU driver
 * IE9 - ok, 30fps at medium res... not great, but at least it works

The current state of mobile browser performance is pretty dismal. Dont expect this to be playable on
any mobile device.

>> _NOTE: I havent actually spent anytime optimizing for performance yet. So it might be possible to
   make it play well on older browsers, but that's not really what this project is about._

>> NOTE: Hopefully, the music tracks used in this project will not be panalized as they are meant to customize and or Kenyanize the game to make it feel more Kenyan since Kenyans are still new to this kind of thing. If you like the music, please purchase them. I hope this acts as a free promo for the music as well.

>> NOTE: the sprite graphics are placeholder graphics [borrowed](http://pixel.garoux.net/game/44) from the old
genesis version of outrun and used here as teaching examples. If there are any pixel artists out there who want to 
provide original art to turn this into a real game please get in touch!
